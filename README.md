## Techniques
  * Language: Dart
  * Framework: Flutter
  * State Management: BLoC
## Main features:
### Common:
  * For manager roles:
    * Add several information of dish, drink, service..., includes: name, description, image, price, type...
    * Manage client reservation history: view, change status(ex: reject for some reasons) or add notes to it.
  * For client roles:
     * View all information about restaurant: basic information and restaurant's products: dish, drink, service... clearly.
     * Make a reservation.
     * Change schedule of reservation or cancel it.
### Special:
  * Automatically reservation: Based on the number of guests, event time, menu, drinks, and services provided by client, the system `automatically arranges tables(without manager intervention) and notifies prepaid fees(if any)`. In case there is a prepaid fee, the person booking the table is required to pay before the specified time. Otherwise, the system will no longer hold the reservation.
  * Messenger-lite: Our website `allows clients to message the manager and vice versa`. This helps the restaurant easily connect and better understand clients' requests as well as make clients express their opinions more clearly to the restaurant.
  * Multi-language: Our website currently supports 2 languages: ENGLISH and VIETNAMESE. Because backend technology is still limited, the data in the database cannot support multiple languages, so some data is only displayed in Vietnamese.

## How to run this code?
### Editor
Firstly, need an IDE/Editor where build and compile code. Highly recommend to using [VSCode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor). Because it's very popular, easy to use and have many extension that make coding more funny and easier.
### Flutter SDK and Dart SDK
See this [original document](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows) to more information.
### Check version
Run `flutter doctor -v` to check version of Flutter and if any missing related to Flutter.
### Now, run it
If you have VSCode and all of above things, now run this.

Step 1: Run `flutter pub get` to get all package/dependency is used in source code.
